Assignment 42
#KNN
#ANSUR II dataset

1- Download dataset from kaggle or openlab website.

2- Preprocess dateset for converting unit of weight, unit of height and datatype of gender.
3- Show heights for women and men on same plot.
    A. Why is the data of men higher than the data of women?
    â€ŒB. Why is the data of men more right than the data of women?

4- Split dataset to train and test datasets (%80 for train and %20 for test):

    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
5- Implement and fit your object oriented KNN algorithm on the train dataset.
6- Evaluate your KNN algorithm on the test dataset with different values of k = 3, 5, 7, ...
and write accuracy results as a table in readme.md.

7- Calculate confusion matrix for test dataset.

8- Fit the scikit-learn KNN algorithm on the train dataset:

from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
9- Evaluate the scikit-learn KNN algorithm on the test dataset. Make sure your accuracy is equal to scikit-learn's accuracy.

10- Calculate confusion matrix using scikit-learn:

**************************
k=3
accuracy=0.8138385502471169
k=5
accuracy=0.8154859967051071
k=7
accuracy=0.8294892915980231
k=9
accuracy=0.8327841845140033

As we can see, the estimation accuracy increases with the increase of "k"
**************************
evaluate accuracy using scikit-learn KNN algorithm:
n_neighbors=3
accuracy=0.8121911037891268
n_neighbors=5
accuracy=0.8171334431630972
n_neighbors=7
accuracy=0.8303130148270181
n_neighbors=9
accuracy=0.8327841845140033
